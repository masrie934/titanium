# This is Titanium

Titanium is an open-source browser that puts you, the user, in the driver seat. Control your privacy, security, and how much of the web you really want.

We are still building the website for this browser. Stay tuned!

This is a fork of a de-Googled Chromium, so still a work in progress.
